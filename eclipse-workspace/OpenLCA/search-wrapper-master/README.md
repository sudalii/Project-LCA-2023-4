# Search wrapper
This project provides an abstraction layer for search engine implementation.

## Build from source

#### Get the source code of the application
We recommend that to use Git to manage the source code but you can also download
the source code as a [zip file](https://github.com/GreenDelta/search-wrapper/archive/master.zip).
Create a development directory (the path should not contain whitespaces):

```bash
mkdir dev
cd dev
```

and get the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GreenDelta/search-wrapper.git
```

#### Build
Now you can build the module with `mvn install`, which will install the module in your local maven repository.
