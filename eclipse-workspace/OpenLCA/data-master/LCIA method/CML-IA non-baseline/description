CML-IA is a LCA methodology developed by the Center of Environmental Science (CML) of Leiden University in The Netherlands (more information on:  http://cml.leiden.edu/software/data-cmlia.html).
CML-IA non-baseline is an extended version of CML-IA  baseline, version 3.00 containing alternative impact categories and recommended for extended LCA's. This method is based on the spreadsheet version 4.7 (August 2016) as published on the CML web site. This method is an update of the previous version CML 2001 (all impact categories). For most impact categories, substances have been added and removed and/or characterisation factors were updated, according to new scientific insight. Some impact categories were added, removed or got a name change.  Eight impact categories were added which contain average charactersiation factors for substance groups (see also list down below). In case the original method only reported a characterisation value for one specific subcompartment, this value is taken as the characterisation value for all subcompartments in this compartment. In case two different characterisation values for emissions to agricultural and industrial soil are available, the value for industrial soil is taken as the characterisation value for all other subcompartments to soil. In case two different characterisation values for emissions to fresh water and to marine water are available, the value for fresh water is taken as the characterisation value for all other subcompartments to water. Marine water is represented by the compartment water (ocean). 
CML-IA  non-baseline has the following extra impact categories compared to CML-IA baseline. Some of the original Ecoinvent names were abbreviated or changed to be clearer to the user: Abiotic depletion (elements, reserve base) is abreviated to Abiotic depletion (elem., reserve base); Abiotic depletion (elements, economic reserve) is abreviated to Abiotic depletion (elem. econ. reserve); Acidification  (fate not included); Eutrophication (incl. fate, average Europe total, A&B), renamed in Eutrophication (incl. fate); GWP 20, renamed to Global warming 20a; GWP 500, renamed to Global warming 500a; Net GWP 100 max, renamed to Upper limit of net global warming; Net GWP 100 min, renamed to Lower limit of net global warming; ODP5, renamed to Ozone layer depletion 5a; ODP10, renamed to Ozone layer depletion 10a; ODP20, renamed to Ozone layer depletion 15a; ODP30, renamed to Ozone layer depletion 20a (20a stands for a time horizon of 20 years); ODP40, renamed to Ozone layer depletion 25a; ODP15, renamed to Ozone layer depletion 30a; ODP25, renamed to Ozone layer depletion 40a; HTP20, renamed to Human toxicity 20a	; HTP100, renamed to Human toxicity 100a; HTP500, renamed to Human toxicity 500a; FAETP 20a, renamed to Freshwater aquatic ecotox. 20a; FAETP 100a, renamed to Freshwater aquatic ecotox. 100a; FAETP 500a, renamed to Freshwater aquatic ecotox. 500a; MAETP 20a, renamed to Marine aquatic ecotox. 20a; MAETP 100a, renamed to Marine aquatic ecotox. 100a; MAETP 500a, renamed to Marine aquatic ecotox. 500a; TAETP 20a, renamed to Terrestrial ecotoxicity 20a; TAETP 100a, renamed to Terrestrial ecotoxicity 100a; TAETP 500a, renamed to terrestrial ecotoxicity 500a; MSETP 20a, renamed to Marine sediment ecotox. 20a; MSETP 100a, renamed to Marine sediment ecotox. 100a; MSETP 500a, renamed to Marine sediment ecotox. 500a; MSETP infinite, renamed to Marine sediment ecotox.

Infinite; Landuse increase of land competition renamed in Land competition; Radiation, renamed in Ionising radiation; POCP low NOx, renamed to Photochemical  oxidation (low NOx; EBIR low NOx, renamed to Photochemical  oxidation (EBIR, low NOx); MIR very high NOx, renamed to Photochemical  oxidation (MIR, very high NOx); MOIR high NOx, renamed to Photochemical  oxidation (MOIR, high NOx); Odour, renamed to malodorous air; Photochemical oxidation (high NOx)(incl.

NMVOC av.); Ozone layer depletion ODP steady state (incl. NMVOC average), renamed to Ozone layer depletion (incl. NMVOC av.).  The last eight impact categories contain average charactersiation factors for substance groups. There are no reference emissions (for normalization factors) of these eight groups for EU25. There are no reference emissions available for normalization factors for photochemical oxidation (MIR, very high NOx), photochemical oxidation (MOIR, high NOx), photochemical oxidation (EBIR, low NOx) and malodorous air. The CML-IA (baseline) method elaborates the problem-oriented (midpoint) approach. The CML Guide provides a list of impact assessment categories grouped into (A) Obligatory impact categories (Category indicators used in most LCAs); (B) Additional impact categories (operational indicators exist, but are not often included in LCA studies); (C) Other impact categories (no operational indicators available, therefore impossible to include quantitatively in LCA). In case several methods are available for obligatory impact categories a baseline indicator is selected, based on the principle of best available practice. These baseline indicators are category indicators at "mid-point level" (problem oriented approach)". Baseline indicators are recommended for simplified studies. The guide provides guidelines for inclusion of other methods and impact category indicators in case of detailed studies and extended studies. In general, baseline indicators do not deviate from the ones in the spreadsheet. In case the spreadsheet contained synonyms of substance names already available in the substance list of the openLCA, the existing names are used. 
Impact categories:
Depletion of abiotic resources: it is related to extraction of minerals and fossil fuels due to inputs in the system. The Abiotic Depletion Factor (ADF) is determined for each extraction of minerals and fossil fuels (kg antimony equivalents/kg extraction) based on concentration reserves and rate of deaccumulation. 
Acidification: the model is developed by Huijbregts and expresses the acidifying potential of substances in kg SO2 equivalents.
Global warming: the characterisation model as developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is selected for development of characterisation factors. Factors are expressed as Global Warming Potential for time horizon 100 years (GWP100), in kg carbon dioxide/kg emission. For the method 'all impact categories', other time horizons are taken.
Ozone layer depletion: the characterisation model is developed by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and defines ozone depletion potential of different gasses (kg CFC-11 equivalent/ kg emission). 
Human toxicity: Characterisation factors, expressed as Human Toxicity Potentials (HTP), are calculated with USES-LCA, describing fate, exposure and effects of toxic substances for an infinite time horizon. For each toxic substance HTP's are expressed as 1,4-dichlorobenzene equivalents/ kg emission.

All adaptations of the method (2001 - 2010) are present in CML-IA_update_info.xls which can be downloaded from the CML website http://cml.leiden.edu/software/data-cmlia.html.

Other adaptations (June 2017, version 3.04): In Land competition category the subcompartment of all flows was set as unspecified. Before, some of the flows had subcompartment land.
Other adaptations (September 2016, version 3.03): Updated characterisation factors in 'Global warming 20a', according to IPCC 2013 report. The original CML-IA spreadsheet did not contain all the substances but after consultation and in agreement with CML they were added so that the implementation is compatible with IPCC 2013. (1) Substances with factor ""<1"" in the IPCC report are not implemented. (2) Factors for Methane, Methane, biogenic and Methane, fossil were implemented according to IPCC report (this causes minor differences, comparing to the method IPCC 2013 GWP 100a, which follows Munoz and Schmidt (2016)*). (3) Category 'Global warming 500a' is now empty because IPCC 2013 does not provide factors for such a long time horizon. (4) Carbon dioxide, to soil or biomass stock (emission to soil) is included due to a change in the modelling of land tenure in Ecoinvent. *Munoz, I. and Schmidt, J.H.

Other adaptations (August 2014, version 3.02): Added metal synonyms to the Abiotic depletion categories. In total 56 per category.
Other adaptations (February 2014): Normalisation factors were corrected (in the previous version, they were not the inverse as they should be in SimaPro).
Other adaptations (October 2013): Characterisation factors for methane, biogenic has been added: Global warming 20a; 69 kg CO2 eq./kg; Global warming 500a; 4,9 kg CO2 eq./kg; Net GWP 100 max, renamed to Upper limit of net global warming; 23 kg CO2 eq./kg; Net GWP 100 min, renamed to Lower limit of net global warming; 23 kg CO2 eq./kg.
Method checked against SimaPro 9.0.0.30.
