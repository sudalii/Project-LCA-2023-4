EF method is the impact assessment method of Environmental Footprint initiative. The implementation is based on EF method 2.0.

PLEASE NOTE! This implementation of the EF method was adapted to better correspond with the libraries provided in SimaPro: (i) additional flows have been included as they are extensively used by the background databases and their synonyms are part of the original EF method; (ii) flows not used by the background databases have been removed from the method. Since the method was modified, it is not anymore suitable for conducting the EF studies. The original version of the method is distributed in a dedicated openLCA database (see https://nexus.openlca.org).

IMPACT CATEGORIES:
EF-Climate Change - Impact indicator: Global Warming Potential 100 years - Baseline model of the IPCC 2013 + some factors Calculated from JRC;
EF-Ozone depletion - Impact indicator: Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) calculating the destructive effects on the stratospheric ozone layer over a time horizon of 100 years;
EF-Ionising radiation - human health - Impact indicator: Ionizing Radiation Potentials: Quantification of the impact of ionizing radiation on the population, in comparison to Uranium 235;
EF-Photochemical ozone formation - human health - Impact indicator: Photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP): Expression of the potential contribution to photochemical ozone formation. Only for Europe. Includes spatial differentiation. Considering a marginal increase in ozone formation, the LOTOS-EUROS spatially differentiated model averages over 14000 grid cells to define European factors.
EF-Respiratory inorganics - Impact indicator: Disease incidence due to kg of PM2.5 emittedThe indicator is calculated applying the average slope between the Emission Response Function (ERF) working point and the theoretical minimum-risk level. Exposure model based on archetypes that include urban environments, rural environments, and indoor environments within urban and rural areas. 
EF-Non-cancer human health effects - Impact indicator: Comparative Toxic Unit for human (CTUh) expressing the estimated increase in morbidity in the total human population per unit mass of a chemical emitted (cases per kilogramme). USEtox consensus model (multimedia model). No spatial differentiation beyond continent and world compartments. Specific groups of chemicals requires further works (cf. details in other sections).
EF-Cancer human health effects - Impact indicator: Comparative Toxic Unit for human (CTUh) expressing the estimated increase in morbidity in the total human population per unit mass of a chemical emitted (cases per kilogramme). USEtox consensus model (multimedia model). No spatial differentiation beyond continent and world compartments. Specific groups of chemicals requires further works (cf. details in other sections).
EF-Acidification terrestrial and freshwater - Impact indicator: Accumulated Exceedance (AE) characterizing the change in critical load exceedance of the sensitive area in terrestrial and main freshwater ecosystems, to which acidifying substances deposit.
EF-Eutrophication freshwater - Impact indicator: Phosphorus equivalents: Expression of the degree to which the emitted nutrients reaches the freshwater end compartment (phosphorus considered as limiting factor in freshwater). European validity. Averaged characterization factors from country dependent characterization factors.
EF-Eutrophication marine - Impact indicator: Nitrogen equivalents: Expression of the degree to which the emitted nutrients reaches the marine end compartment (nitrogen considered as limiting factor in marine water).
EF-Eutrophication terrestrial - Impact indicator: Accumulated Exceedance (AE) characterizing the change in critical load exceedance of the sensitive area, to which eutrophying substances deposit.
EF-Ecotoxicity freshwater - Impact indicator: Comparative Toxic Unit for ecosystems (CTUe) expressing an estimate of the potentially affected fraction of species (PAF) integrated over time and volume per unit mass of a chemical emitted (PAF m3 year/kg). USEtox consensus model (multimedia model). No spatial differentiation beyond continent and world compartments. Specific groups of chemicals requires further works (cf. details in other sections).
EF-Land Use - Impact indicator: Soil quality index. CFs set was re-Calculated by JRC starting from LANCA® v 2.2 as baseline model. Out of 5 original indicators only 4 have been included in the aggregation (physico-chemical filtration was excluded due to the high correlation with the mechanical filtration). 
EF-Water scarcity - Impact indicator: m3 water eq. deprived. Relative Available WAter REmaining (AWARE) per area in a watershed, after the demand of humans and aquatic ecosystems has been met. 
EF-Resource use, energy carriers - Impact indicator: Abiotic resource depletion fossil fuels (ADP-fossil); based on lower heating value. ADP for energy carriers, based on van Oers et al. 2002 as implemented in CML, v. 4.8 (2016). Depletion model based on use-to-availability ratio. Full substitution among fossil energy carriers is assumed.
EF-Resource use, mineral and metals - Impact indicator: Abiotic resource depletion (ADP ultimate reserve). ADP for mineral and metal resources, based on van Oers et al. 2002 as implemented in CML, v. 4.8 (2016). Depletion model based on use-to-availability ratio. Full substitution among fossil energy carriers is assumed.
Adaptations by PRé Consultants: (i) this implementation of EF method does not include any substances, which would be new to SimaPro, e.g. regionalised land use flows and Carbon dioxide, biogenic (100yr). None of those flows is used in the SimaPro libraries and would not contribute to the results. (ii) additional substances have been included as they are extensively used by the background databases and their synonyms are part of the original EF method: (1) Resource use, energy carriers - flows expressed in mass units (not only in net calorific value as in EF); characterisation factor corresponds to the lower heating values of given fuel; (2) Resource use, mineral and metals - additional flows for already characterised mineral and metals; (3) Water scarcity - flows representing geographies not covered in the original EF method; global factor was applied; (4) Climate change - carbon dioxide (emission to air) is added with factor of carbon dioxide, fossil, carbon dioxide, to soil or biomass stock is added with factor -1 (this flow is necessary for the correct modeling of land use in ecoinvent).
Method checked against SimaPro 9.0.0.30.
