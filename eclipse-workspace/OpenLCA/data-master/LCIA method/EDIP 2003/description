EDIP2003 is a Danish LCA methodology that is presented as an alternative to the EDIP97 methodology. (contact info: http://www.lca-center.dk/cms/site.aspx?p=4441).
The main innovation of EDIP2003 lies in the consistent attempt to include exposure in the characterisation modelling of the main non-global impact categories. EDIP2003 can originally be used both with and without spatial differentiation. Only characterisation factor for site-generic effects, which does not take spatial variation into account, are implemented. The EDIP2003 methodology includes 18 different impact categories. Some of them are directly taken from EDIP97, some are updated versions of EDIP97, whereas others are modelled totally different. 
Impact categories:
Global warming: Time horizon of 100 years is used and extended with extra factors from EI 2.0; Ozone depletion; Acidification (original form); Terrestrial eutrophication (original form); Aquatic eutrophication (N-eq): Only emissions to inland waters are included. Emissions to air included; Aquatic eutrophication (P-eq) (original form);  Ozone formation (human): Extended with extra factors from EI 2.0; Ozone formation (vegetation): Extended with extra factors from EI 2.0; Human toxicity (exposure route via air): Release height of 25m; Human toxicity (exposure route via water) (original form); Human toxicity (exposure route via soil) (original form); Ecotoxicity (water acute) (original form); Ecotoxicity (water chronic) (original form); Ecotoxicity (soil chronic) (original form); Resources: Taken directly from EDIP 97 (updated in 2004); Waste: Taken directly from EDIP 97 (updated in 2004).
In the EDIP 2003 method, characterisation factors for aquatic eutrophication are developed for two impact categories: Aquatic eutrophication EP(N) and Aquatic eutrophication EP(P). In each impact category, characterisation factors for emissions effecting inland waters and emissions effecting marine waters are developed. This double set of characterisation factors reflect the fact that, in general, eutrophication is limited by Nitrate in fresh waters, and Phosphate in marine waters. In order to avoid double counting, that would occur if both emission types are implemented simultaneously, only the characterisation factors for inland water are implemented. When characterisation factors for marine water are needed, see guidline EDIP 2003 or database manual. The emission to soil only takes into account the effects after plant uptake. For this impact category the topsoil is part of the techno sphere.  Emission to air are also included in the model. The data needed for this compartment is not present in the guideline, but is received from Michael Hauschild.
The EDIP2003 characterisation factors for human toxicity, exposure route via air, are enhanced. The new exposure factors are established for: (1) Two different kinds of substances: short-living (hydrogen chloride) and long-living (benzene); (2) Actual variation in regional and local population densities: added for each substance; (3) Different release heights: 1m, 25m and 100m (the release height of 25m is presented as default in EDIP2003 and is used ). (4) For global warming a time horizon of 100 years is recommended by EDIP2003. (5) In the impact categories "ozone formation", for the substance isobutene, two synonyms with the same cas-number and a different characterisation factor are found. Next characterisation factors are used: Ozone formation (human): Isobutene: 9,44E-05; Ozone formation (vegetation): Isobutene: 1,168; (6) The impact category resources is not mentioned and considered in EDIP2003. For calculating effects of within this impact category, the method EDIP/UMP 97 (resources only), available in SimaPro 7.0, can be used. The impact categories waste are directly taken from EDIP 1997 (with updated factors from 2004). 
Normalisation: Except for ecotoxicity, all the different impact categories are normalized in the same way as in EDIP97, only using EDIP2003 normalisation references. Due to lack of data, no EDIP2003 normalisation references for any of the ecotoxicity categories is calculated and they are set equal to zero. For the impact categories waste normalization factors of EDIP 1997 are used.
Weighting: The weighting factors of EDIP97, which were updated in 2004, are also used in EDIP2003. Because ecotoxicity has no normalisation factors, also for weighting the value is zero. For the impact categories waste weighting factors of EDIP 1997 (with updated factors from 2004) are used.

Other adaptations (November 2018, version 1.07): Factor for Methane, land transformation was added in Global warming 100a.
Other adaptations (November 2016, v 1.06): Carbon dioxide, to soil or biomass stock (emission to soil) is included in Global warming due to a change in the modelling of land tenure in Ecoinvent.
Other adaptations (August 2014, v 1.05): Added metal synonyms to the Resources category. Copper, Cu 0.38%; Au 9.7E-4%; Ag 9.7E-4%; Zn 0.63%; Pb 0.014%, in ore; Copper, Cu 0.2%, in mixed ore; Gold, Au 1.8E-4%, in mixed ore; Gold, Au 5.4E-4%; Ag 1.5E-5%, in ore; Gold, Au 6.8E-4%, Ag 1.5E-4%, in ore; Gold, Au 9.7E-5%, Ag 7.6E-5%, in ore; Lead, Pb 3.6E-1%, in mixed ore; Silver, Ag 1.5E-4%, Au 6.8E-4%, in ore; Silver, Ag 1.5E-5%, Au 5.4E-4%, in ore; Silver, Ag 5.4E-3%, in mixed ore; Silver, Ag 7.6E-5%, Au 9.7E-5%, in ore; Silver, Ag 9.7E-4%, Au 9.7E-4%, Zn 0.63%, Cu 0.38%, Pb 0.014%, in ore; Zinc, Zn 3.1%, in mixed ore.

Other adaptations (July 2011, v 1.03): (1) The normalization factor for 'Radioactive waste' with normalization reference equal to 0.16 kg/person/yr was corrected to 6.25.- The normalization factors for all impact categories were updated.

Int J LCA 16, pp.401-409. (2) The indicator of resource depletion in EDIP2003 relates the consumption of a given resource in your system (kg-res/f.u.) to the total known reserves per person (kg-res/pers) for that resource in a reference year, here 2004. The characterization factors for this impact category shall be expressed in PR2004/(kg-resource or m3), where PR2004 are Person-Reserves based on the consumption in 2004. (3) Characterization unit for ""Human toxicity via air"" (m3) was replaced by ""person"".
Other adaptations (November 2009, v 1.02): (1) The use of biogenic CO2 has been revised: 'carbon dioxide, in air' in global warming (Global warming 100a) has been removed; 'carbon dioxide, biogenic' in global warming (Global warming 100a) has been removed; 'carbon mono oxide, biogenic' in global warming (Global warming 100a) has been removed; Characterization factor of 'Methane, biogenic' in global warming 100a changed from 23 to 20.
Other adaptation (April 2008, v1.01): (1) The impact category 'Global warming 100a' is adapted. The substance 'carbon dioxide, in air' is added, with the negative characterisation factor of carbon dioxide.
