The Cumulative Energy Demand (LHV) method was created by PRé Consultants based on data published by ecoinvents for raw materials available in the SimaPro database. The method calculates  Lower Heating Values (LHV), for higher heating values (HHV) use the Cumulative Energy Demand method. Ratio between lower and higher heating value for each fuel type was derived from “Overview and methodology - Data quality guideline for the ecoinvent database version 3 (Table 5.1)”. It was then used to convert the higher heating values from the default Cumulative Energy Demand method into lower heating values. For peat this ratio was not available in the Data quality guideline, therefore we assume a slightly lower ratio than what was calculated for lignite (0.85).
Method checked against SimaPro 9.0.0.30.
