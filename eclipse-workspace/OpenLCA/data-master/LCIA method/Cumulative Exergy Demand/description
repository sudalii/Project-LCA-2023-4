Cumulative Exergy Demand method is directly taken from Ecoinvent 2.0. Amount of substances present are compatible with the Ecoinvent 2.0 database and extended for other databases. Contact info: http://www.ecoinvent.org/contact/.
Exergy is another way to express energy contents than energy content itself. Both are expressed in MJ. Exergy is a measure for the useful "work" a certain energy carrier can offer. For instance, natural gas has a high exergy value, as it can be used to create high temperatures and high pressured steam. If Natural gas is used to heat a house in a highly efficient boiler, very little energy content is lost, but the exergy content is almost entirely lost (there is very little one can do with water between 50 and 80 degrees).
In this method exergy is used as a measure of the potential loss of "useful" energy resources. Normalisation is not a part of this method. Weighting: Each impact category is given the weighting factor 1. For more information see the Database manual. 
Other adaptations (February 2016, v1.05): 'Energy, from uranium' was moved from category 'Non renewable, fossil' to 'Non renewable, nuclear'.
Other adaptations (August 2014, v1.04): (1) Added 27 fossil resource flows to the Non-renewable, fossil category. (2) Added 5 nuclear resource flows to the Non-renewable, nuclear category. (3) Added 16 metal resource flows to the Non-renewable, metals category. (4) Added 1490 regionalized water flows to the Renewable, water category.
Other adaptations (May 2014, v1.03): factor for water, turbine use (Renewable, water) changed into 0 MJ/kg; factor for Tantalum (Non renewable, metals) changed into 8.18E+5 MJ/kg.
Other adaptations (August 2010, v1.02): the quantity and unit of the single score is changed: v1.01: Indicator (Pt), v1.02: Energy (MJ).
