Method to calculate Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), based on the method published by ecoinvent version 2.0 and expanded by PRÃ© Consultants for raw materials available in the SimaPro 7 database. 
The method is based on higher heating values (HHV). Contact info: http://www.ecoinvent.org/contact/Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., et.al. (2003). Implementation of Life Cycle Impact Assessment Methods. Final report ecoinvent 2000, Swiss Centre for LCI. Duebendorf, CH, www.ecoinvent.ch
Wood is not included in this methodology due to the frequent use of wood as feedstock in Simapro.
Normalization is not a part of this method. Weighting: Each impact category is given the weighting factor 1. 
Other adaptations (November 2018, v1.11): Updated characterisation factors for the remaining 6 flows in category Non renewable, fossil. Previously, their characterisation factors were calculated based on LHV instead of HHV. 
Other adaptations (November 2017, v1.10): Updated characterisation factors for 22 flows in category Non renewable, fossil. Previously, their characterisation factors were calculated using LHV instead of HHV. 
Other adaptations (August 2014, v1.09): (1) The following flows were added: Coal, bituminous, 24.8 MJ per kg; Coal, hard, 30.7 MJ per kg; Gas, natural/kg; (2) The factor for Methane was changed from 35.9 to 55.53 MJ/kg (the previous value was in MJ/m3, which is the incorrect unit).
Other adaptations (August 2010, v1.08): The quantity and unit of the single score is changed: v1.07: Indicator (Pt), v1.08: Energy (MJ).
Other adaptations (March 2010, v1.07): The weighting factor of impact category non-renewable biomass was changed to 1.
Other adaptations (November 2009, v1.06): Created a new impact category: 'Non-renewable, biomass' and moved the substance 'energy, gross calorific value, in biomass, primairy forest' to this new impact category.
Other adaptations (April 2008, v1.05): (1) Seven extra substance flows are added:           Energy, gross calorific value, in biomas, primary forest'; Geothermal converted'; Energy, solar, converted'; Energy, from hydrogen'; Energy, unspecified'; (2) The characterisation factor of Peat, in ground' raw biotic in IC non renewable, fossil has a new characterisation factor = 9.
Other adaptations (February 2008, v1.04): Minor adaptations in Unit names and Impact category names (capitals, points) for more consistency with other categories.
Other adaptations (August 2005, v1.03): In impact category Non renewable, fossil the characterisation value for "Gas, natural in ground" has been changed from 40,3 to 38.3 MJ LHV/m3 following the ecoinvent 1.2 update.
Other adaptations (March 2005, v1.02): Sulphur removed.
Other adaptations (August 2004, v1.01): Added: Additional oil resources; Water, barrage. Corrected values: Uranium ore, 1.11 GJ per kg, in ground; Uranium, 2291 GJ per kg, in ground; Uranium, 451 GJ per kg, in ground; Uranium, 560 GJ per kg, in ground. Not included: Energy from hydrogen; Energy, recovered; Energy, unspecified; Oil; Steam from waste incineration.
