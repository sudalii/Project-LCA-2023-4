Berger et al 2014 (Water Scarcity) is based on the following publication: Markus Berger, Ruud van der Ent, Stephanie Eisner, Vanessa Bach, and Matthias Finkbeiner. 2014. Water Accounting and Vulnerability Evaluation (WAVE): Considering Atmospheric Evaporation Recycling and the Risk of Freshwater Depletion in Water Footprinting. Environ. Sci. Technol., 2014, 48 (8), pp 4521â€“4528. 
The method analyzes the vulnerability of basins to freshwater depletion. Based on local blue water scarcity, the water depletion index (WDI) denotes the risk that water consumption can lead to depletion of freshwater resources. Water scarcity is determined by relating annual water consumption to availability in more than 11,000 basins. Additionally, WDI accounts for the presence of lakes and aquifers which have been neglected in water scarcity assessments so far. By setting WDI to the highest value in (semi)arid basins, absolute freshwater shortage is taken into account in addition to relative scarcity. This avoids mathematical artifacts of previous indicators which turn zero in deserts if consumption is zero. The regional factors are weighted averages based on the freshwater withdrawal by country data from the Pacific Institute (http://www.worldwater.org/data.html). After calculating your results, checks if any significant country-based flows have been omitted due to the incomplete list of characterisation factors.
