Boulay et al 2011 (Water Scarcity) is based on the following publication: Boulay, A.-M.; Bulle, C.; Bayart, J.-B.; Deschenes, L.; Margni, M. Regional Characterization of Freshwater Use in LCA: Modeling Direct Impacts on Human Health Environmental Science & Technology 2011, 45, 8948-8957.
This water scarcity indicator (WSI) method is based on a consumption to availability (CTA) ratio and modelled using a logistic function (S-curve) in order to fit the resulting indicator to values between 0 and 1 m3 deprived/m3 consumed. The curve is tuned using OECD water stress thresholds, which define moderate and severe water stress as 20% and 40% of withdrawals, respectively and converted with an empirical correlation between withdrawal to availability (WTA) and CTA. The scarcity indicators are also available for surface and groundwater. Water consumption and availability data are taken from the WaterGap model. The indicator is applied to the consumed water volume and assesses consumptive water use only.
The regional factors are weighted averages based on the freshwater withdrawal by country data from the Pacific Institute (http://www.worldwater.org/data.html After calculating your results, checks if any significant country-based flows have been omitted due to the incomplete list of characterisation factors. 
Other adaptation (August 2014, version 1.02): Added water flows based on new ecoinvent regions, assuming the factors are the same for the following equivalent regions: IAI Area 1 (Africa) = RAF (Africa); IAI Area 2, without Quebec (North America) = RNA (North America); IAI Area 3 (South America) = RLA (Latin America); IAI Area 4&5 without China (Asia) = RAS (Asia); IAI Area 8 (Gulf region) = SA (Saudi Arabia); UN-EUROPE = RER (Europe); UN-OCEANIA = AU (Australia).
Other adaptation (February 2014, version 1.01): Added factors for regionalized flows starting with "Water, cooling, unspecified natural origin" and "Water, turbine use, unspecified natural origin".
Method checked against SimaPro 9.0.0.30.
